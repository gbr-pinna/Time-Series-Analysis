# Time-Series-Analysis

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook introduces key concepts and techniques in time series analysis, focusing on three important models:

1. **OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) Regression**: A fundamental method for estimating the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In time series analysis, it is used to model the linear relationship between the time and the variable of interest, often applied to identify trends or to build a simple predictive model.

2. **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: A model for forecasting univariate time series data that exhibits trends and seasonality. It combines autoregression (AR), differencing (I), and moving averages (MA) to make predictions.

3. **GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)**: A model used to model volatility clustering and time-varying variance, especially in financial data. It is useful for analyzing and forecasting the volatility of asset returns, where periods of high volatility tend to be followed by more high volatility.

These models are essential tools in forecasting, financial modeling, and econometrics. This notebook will guide you through the basic theory and Python implementation of **OLS Regression**, **ARIMA**, and **GARCH** models.

## Key Sections

- **OLS Regression**: Introduction to **Ordinary Least Squares** (OLS) regression, focusing on modeling the relationship between time (or other predictors) and the target variable. You will learn how to apply OLS regression using **`statsmodels`** and interpret the results in the context of time series data.

- **ARIMA Model**: Understanding the AR, I, and MA components, model identification using ACF/PACF, and forecasting with ARIMA.

- **GARCH Model**: Modeling financial data volatility, understanding heteroskedasticity, and fitting GARCH models to financial time series to analyze and predict volatility.

- **Python Code**: Practical examples using the `statsmodels` and `arch` libraries for **OLS Regression**, **ARIMA**, and **GARCH** modeling.

## Conclusion

This notebook equips you with the tools to analyze time series data using **OLS Regression**, **ARIMA**, and **GARCH** models. Youâ€™ll learn how to use **OLS Regression** to model linear relationships in time series data, **ARIMA** for forecasting with trends and seasonality, and **GARCH** for modeling financial volatility. These techniques are widely used in various applications, including financial analysis, econometrics, and forecasting.
